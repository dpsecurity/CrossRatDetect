## About
CrossRatDetect is a tool to detect and remove CrossRat from infected Linux systems. Windows and MacOS are not supported yet!

Note that this is not a vulnerability scanner, it is a malware scanner used to identify compromised web application installations/systems. 

## Signs of infections
The RAT always uses the same user agent (CrossRatSpider) to send HTTP requests during the scanning for vulnerable servers. 
Normally a machine which sends requests using the above user agent has to be considered as infected.

To double check it's reccommended to verify the presence of the folder /tmp/crcache which should contains a list of files, one for
each IP address which has been scanned.
